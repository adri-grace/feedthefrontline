# Feed the Frontline
A Django web application for connecting donors, restaurants and healthcare workers on the frontline.

### Background
Our General Assembly cohort has been together since before COVID-19 emerged. It has offered us a constant while much in our daily lives changed rapidly and dramatically. We were broken into small groups for a final project just 2 weeks into stay-at-home orders for everyone in our cohort. We all wanted to use our new skills to help people and communities around us.

Inspired by conversations with friends in the restaurant and catering business, our team quickly agreed on an app that would support both local restaurants and offer meals to frontline healthcare providers.

> Health care workers, exhausted from pulling long shifts, have little time to eat a good meal.

Our model is different than others, in that restaurants can sign up themselves and donors can select which restaurant they'd like to donate to. A bonus for the restaurants â€” they get a little name recognition that can carry over into new patrons once they can reopen.
